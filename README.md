# Assembltrie
Assembltrie is a software tool for compressing collections of (fixed length) Illumina reads, written in C++14 and is availble under an open-source license. Currently, Assembltrie is the only FASTQ compressor that approaches the information theory limit for a given short read collection uniformly sampled from an underlying reference genome. Assembltrie becomes the first FASTQ compressor that achieves both combinatorial optimality and information theoretic optimality under fair assumptions.
